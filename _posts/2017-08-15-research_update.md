As my research at Oregon State comes to a close, I've started shifting my thinking towards future projects that could
contribute to a better understanding of the web dynamics as a whole, perhaps from a computational perspective. Particularly,
I am interested in explanding our current understanding of the vibrational dynamcis in terms of individual string junctions.

I'm considering starting a project that will approach an understanding of vibrational dynamics at web nodes from two
perspectives: firstly, I will explore computationally how we can expect a planar network of strings to behave, starting
from past extensive explorations of networks of nonlinear elastic strings, drawing especially from "Modeling, Analysis and
Control of Dynamic Elastic Multi-Link Structures" written by E.J.P.G. Schmidt et. al, published in 1994. I intend to use
this background to create a computational model of dynamics at a junction.

To expand upon this computational model, I'm considering using accelerometers and a simple paracord setup to monitor
vibration amplitudes at different points in the network. Ideally, this would either confirm or help me tune the previously
described computational model. In the long run, this computational model could be used as a building block to understanding
a larger string network with this setup as a sub-component. Additionally, I'll be able to ask questions about energy
dissipation through the string junctions and discover an ideal radial to spiral tension ratio for the paracord segments
involved.
