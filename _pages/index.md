Hello! My name is Jillian Rix, and I'm a third year physics major at Grinnell College intending to complete a dual Bachelor's degree in Physics and Mechanical Engineering. My main research interests include nonlinear and vibrational dynamics, as well as humanitarian and environmental engineering applications. I'm particularly interested in sustainable energy harvesting and conversion.
